## Simple Weather React App

This is a simple weather app that was built on the **React** framework. 

To run it the app:
1. _Clone_ or _Download_ the repository;
1. Get an API key from **https://openweathermap.org/api**;
1. By default, I used to keep the API key in the _src/keys/apiKey.js_. Add the key either to the same file, or change the directory in the **WeatherList.js** file. 
1. After adding the key, use the standard **npm start** command.
1. To view the app, go to **http://localhost:3000**;

The app was created on the **create-react-app** boilerplate, so it may have some not needed modules.

Just to reiterate, this was created by an _entry-junior level developer_, so if you see any mistakes, just do a quick pull request. Appreciate it!
